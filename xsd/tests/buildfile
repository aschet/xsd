# Avoid cleaning exe{xsd} through this dependency.
#
# Note that otherwise the executable will be cleaned by the bbot worker at the
# end of the bpkg.test step while running `b clean(xsd/tests/)`. That would be
# prematurely, since the not yet tested xsd-tests and xsd-examples packages
# also depend on it.
