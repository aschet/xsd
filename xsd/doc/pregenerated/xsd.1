.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"--------------------------------------------------------------------
.B xsd
generates vocabulary-specific, statically-typed C++ mapping from W3C XML
Schema definitions. Particular mapping to produce is selected by a
.IR command .
Each mapping has a number of mapping-specific
.I options
that should appear, if any, after the
.IR command .
Input files should be W3C XML Schema definitions. The exact set of the
generated files depends on the selected mapping and options.

.SH COMMANDS
.\"--------------------------------------------------------------------
.IP \fBcxx-tree\fR
Generate the C++/Tree mapping. For each input file in the form
.B name.xsd
the following C++ files are generated:
.B name.hxx
(header file),
.B name.ixx
(inline file, generated only if the
.B --generate-inline
option is specified),
.B name.cxx
(source file), and
.B name-fwd.hxx
(forward declaration file, generated only if the
.B --generate-forward
option is specified).

.IP \fBcxx-parser\fR
Generate the C++/Parser mapping. For each input file in the form
.B name.xsd
the following C++ files are generated:
.B name-pskel.hxx
(parser skeleton header file),
.B name-pskel.ixx
(parser skeleton inline file, generated only if the
.B --generate-inline
option is specified), and
.B name-pskel.cxx
(parser skeleton source file). If the
.B --generate-noop-impl
or
.B --generate-print-impl
option is specified, the following additional sample implementation files
are generated:
.B name-pimpl.hxx
(parser implementation header file) and
.B name-pimpl.cxx
(parser implementation source file). If the
.B --generate-test-driver
option is specified, the additional
.B name-driver.cxx
test driver file is generated.

.IP "\fB--std\fR \fIversion\fR"
Specify the C++ standard that the generated code should conform to\. Valid
values are \fBc++98\fR (default) and \fBc++11\fR\.

The C++ standard affects various aspects of the generated code that are
discussed in more detail in various mapping-specific documentation\. Overall,
when C++11 is selected, the generated code relies on the move semantics and
uses \fBstd::unique_ptr\fR instead of deprecated \fBstd::auto_ptr\fR\.

When the C++11 mode is selected, you normally don't need to perform any extra
steps other than enable C++11 in your C++ compiler, if required\. The XSD
compiler will automatically add the necessary macro defines to the generated
header files that will switch the header-only XSD runtime library
(\fBlibxsd\fR) to the C++11 mode\. However, if you include any of the XSD
runtime headers directly in your application (normally you just include the
generated headers), then you will need to define the \fBXSD_CXX11\fR macro for
your entire project\.
.IP "\fB--char-type\fR \fItype\fR"
Generate code using the provided character \fItype\fR instead of the default
\fBchar\fR\. Valid values are \fBchar\fR and \fBwchar_t\fR\.
.IP "\fB--char-encoding\fR \fIenc\fR"
Specify the character encoding that should be used in the generated code\.
Valid values for the \fBchar\fR character type are \fButf8\fR (default),
\fBiso8859-1\fR, \fBlcp\fR (Xerces-C++ local code page), and \fBcustom\fR\. If
you pass \fBcustom\fR as the value then you will need to include the
transcoder implementation header for your encoding at the beginning of the
generated header files (see the \fB--hxx-prologue\fR option)\.

For the \fBwchar_t\fR character type the only valid value is \fBauto\fR and
the encoding is automatically selected between UTF-16 and UTF-32/UCS-4,
depending on the \fBwchar_t\fR type size\.
.IP "\fB--output-dir\fR \fIdir\fR"
Write generated files to \fIdir\fR instead of the current directory\.
.IP "\fB--generate-inline\fR"
Generate simple functions inline\. This option triggers creation of the inline
file\.
.IP "\fB--generate-xml-schema\fR"
Generate a C++ header file as if the schema being compiled defines the XML
Schema namespace\. For the C++/Tree mapping, the resulting file will contain
definitions for all XML Schema built-in types\. For the C++/Parser mapping,
the resulting file will contain definitions for all the parser skeletons and
implementations corresponding to the XML Schema built-in types\.

The schema file provided to the compiler need not exist and is only used to
derive the name of the resulting header file\. Use the
\fB--extern-xml-schema\fR option to include this file in the generated files
for other schemas\.
.IP "\fB--extern-xml-schema\fR \fIfile\fR"
Include a header file derived from \fIfile\fR instead of generating the XML
Schema namespace mapping inline\. The provided file need not exist and is only
used to derive the name of the included header file\. Use the
\fB--generate-xml-schema\fR option to generate this header file\.
.IP "\fB--namespace-map\fR \fIxns\fR=\fIcns\fR"
Map XML Schema namespace \fIxns\fR to C++ namespace \fIcns\fR\. Repeat this
option to specify mapping for more than one XML Schema namespace\. For
example, the following option:

\fB--namespace-map http://example\.com/foo/bar=foo::bar\fR

Will map the \fBhttp://example\.com/foo/bar\fR XML Schema namespace to the
\fBfoo::bar\fR C++ namespace\.
.IP "\fB--namespace-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Add \fIregex\fR to the list of regular expressions used to translate XML
Schema namespace names to C++ namespace names\. \fIregex\fR is a Perl-like
regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. Any character can be
used as a delimiter instead of '\fB/\fR'\. Escaping of the delimiter character
in \fIpattern\fR or \fIreplacement\fR is not supported\.

All the regular expressions are pushed into a stack with the last specified
expression considered first\. The first match that succeeds is used\. Regular
expressions are applied to a string in the form

\fIfilename\fR \fInamespace\fR\fR

For example, if you have file \fBhello\.xsd\fR with namespace
\fBhttp://example\.com/hello\fR and you run \fBxsd\fR on this file, then the
string in question will be:

\fBhello\.xsd\. http://example\.com/hello\fR

For the built-in XML Schema namespace the string is:

\fBXMLSchema\.xsd http://www\.w3\.org/2001/XMLSchema\fR

The following three steps are performed for each regular expression until the
match is found:

1\. The expression is applied and if the result is empty the next expression
is considered\.

2\. All '\fB/\fR' are replaced with '\fB::\fR'\.

3\. The result is verified to be a valid C++ scope name (e\.g\.,
\fBfoo::bar\fR)\. If this test succeeds, the result is used as a C++ namespace
name\.

As an example, the following expression maps XML  Schema namespaces in the
form \fBhttp://example\.com/foo/bar\fR to C++ namespaces in the form
\fBfoo::bar\fR:

\fB%\.* http://example\.com/(\.+)%$1%\fR

See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--namespace-regex-trace\fR"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the
\fB--namespace-regex\fR option\. Use this option to find out why your regular
expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.
.IP "\fB--reserved-name\fR \fIn\fR[=\fIr\fR]"
Add name \fIn\fR to the list of names that should not be used as identifiers\.
The name can optionally be followed by \fB=\fR and the replacement name
\fIr\fR that should be used instead\. All the C++ keywords are already in this
list\.
.IP "\fB--include-with-brackets\fR"
Use angle brackets (<>) instead of quotes ("") in generated \fB#include\fR
directives\.
.IP "\fB--include-prefix\fR \fIprefix\fR"
Add \fIprefix\fR to generated \fB#include\fR directive paths\.

For example, if you had the following import element in your schema

\fB<import namespace="\.\.\." schemaLocation="base\.xsd"/>\fR

and compiled this fragment with \fB--include-prefix schemas/\fR, then the
include directive in the generated code would be:

\fB#include "schemas/base\.hxx"\fR
.IP "\fB--include-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Add \fIregex\fR to the list of regular expressions used to transform
\fB#include\fR directive paths\. \fIregex\fR is a Perl-like regular expression
in the form \fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. Any
character can be used as a delimiter instead of '\fB/\fR'\. Escaping of the
delimiter character in \fIpattern\fR or \fIreplacement\fR is not supported\.

All the regular expressions are pushed into a stack with the last specified
expression considered first\. The first match that succeeds is used\.

As an example, the following expression transforms paths in the form
\fBschemas/foo/bar\fR to paths in the form \fBgenerated/foo/bar\fR:

\fB%schemas/(\.+)%generated/$1%\fR

See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--include-regex-trace\fR"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the
\fB--include-regex\fR option\. Use this option to find out why your regular
expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.
.IP "\fB--guard-prefix\fR \fIprefix\fR"
Add \fIprefix\fR to generated header inclusion guards\. The prefix is
transformed to upper case and characters that are illegal in a preprocessor
macro name are replaced with underscores\. If this option is not specified
then the directory part of the input schema file is used as a prefix\.
.IP "\fB--hxx-suffix\fR \fIsuffix\fR"
Use the provided \fIsuffix\fR instead of the default \fB\.hxx\fR to construct
the name of the header file\. Note that this suffix is also used to construct
names of header files corresponding to included/imported schemas\.
.IP "\fB--ixx-suffix\fR \fIsuffix\fR"
Use the provided \fIsuffix\fR instead of the default \fB\.ixx\fR to construct
the name of the inline file\.
.IP "\fB--cxx-suffix\fR \fIsuffix\fR"
Use the provided \fIsuffix\fR instead of the default \fB\.cxx\fR to construct
the name of the source file\.
.IP "\fB--fwd-suffix\fR \fIsuffix\fR"
Use the provided \fIsuffix\fR instead of the default \fB-fwd\.hxx\fR to
construct the name of the forward declaration file\.
.IP "\fB--hxx-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Use the provided expression to construct the name of the header file\.
\fIregex\fR is a Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. Note that this
expression is also used to construct names of header files corresponding to
included/imported schemas\. See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section
below\.
.IP "\fB--ixx-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Use the provided expression to construct the name of the inline file\.
\fIregex\fR is a Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. See also the REGEX
AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--cxx-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Use the provided expression to construct the name of the source file\.
\fIregex\fR is a Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. See also the REGEX
AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--fwd-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Use the provided expression to construct the name of the forward declaration
file\. \fIregex\fR is a Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. See also the REGEX
AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--hxx-prologue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the beginning of the header file\.
.IP "\fB--ixx-prologue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the beginning of the inline file\.
.IP "\fB--cxx-prologue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the beginning of the source file\.
.IP "\fB--fwd-prologue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the beginning of the forward declaration file\.
.IP "\fB--prologue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the beginning of each generated file for which there is
no file-specific prologue\.
.IP "\fB--hxx-epilogue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the end of the header file\.
.IP "\fB--ixx-epilogue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the end of the inline file\.
.IP "\fB--cxx-epilogue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the end of the source file\.
.IP "\fB--fwd-epilogue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the end of the forward declaration file\.
.IP "\fB--epilogue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the end of each generated file for which there is no
file-specific epilogue\.
.IP "\fB--hxx-prologue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the beginning of the header file\.
.IP "\fB--ixx-prologue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the beginning of the inline file\.
.IP "\fB--cxx-prologue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the beginning of the source file\.
.IP "\fB--fwd-prologue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the beginning of the forward
declaration file\.
.IP "\fB--prologue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the beginning of each generated file
for which there is no file-specific prologue file\.
.IP "\fB--hxx-epilogue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the end of the header file\.
.IP "\fB--ixx-epilogue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the end of the inline file\.
.IP "\fB--cxx-epilogue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the end of the source file\.
.IP "\fB--fwd-epilogue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the end of the forward declaration
file\.
.IP "\fB--epilogue-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Insert the content of the \fIfile\fR at the end of each generated file for
which there is no file-specific epilogue file\.
.IP "\fB--export-symbol\fR \fIsymbol\fR"
Insert \fIsymbol\fR in places where DLL export/import control statements
(\fB__declspec(dllexport/dllimport)\fR) are necessary\.
.IP "\fB--export-xml-schema\fR"
Export/import types in the XML Schema namespace using the export symbol
provided with the \fB--export-symbol\fR option\. The \fBXSD_NO_EXPORT\fR macro
can be used to omit this code during C++ compilation, which may be useful if
you would like to use the same generated code across multiple platforms\.
.IP "\fB--export-maps\fR"
Export polymorphism support maps from a Win32 DLL into which this generated
code is placed\. This is necessary when your type hierarchy is split across
several DLLs since otherwise each DLL will have its own set of maps\. In this
situation the generated code for the DLL which contains base types and/or
substitution group heads should be compiled with this option and the generated
code for all other DLLs should be compiled with \fB--import-maps\fR\. This
option is only valid together with \fB--generate-polymorphic\fR\. The
\fBXSD_NO_EXPORT\fR macro can be used to omit this code during C++
compilation, which may be useful if you would like to use the same generated
code across multiple platforms\.
.IP "\fB--import-maps\fR"
Import polymorphism support maps to a Win32 DLL or executable into which this
generated code is linked\. See the \fB--export-maps\fR option documentation
for details\. This options is only valid together with
\fB--generate-polymorphic\fR\. The \fBXSD_NO_EXPORT\fR macro can be used to
omit this code during C++ compilation, which may be useful if you would like
to use the same generated code across multiple platforms\.
.IP "\fB--generate-dep\fR"
Generate \fBmake\fR dependency information\. This option triggers the creation
of the \fB\.d\fR file containing the dependencies of the generated files on
the main schema file as well as all the schema files that it includes/imports,
transitively\. This dependency file is then normally included into the main
\fBmakefile\fR to implement automatic dependency tracking\.

Note also that automatic dependency generation is not supported in the
file-per-type mode (\fB--file-per-type\fR)\. In this case, all the generated
files are produced with a single compiler invocation and depend on all the
schemas\. As a result, it is easier to establish such a dependency manually,
perhaps with the help of the \fB--file-list*\fR options\.
.IP "\fB--generate-dep-only\fR"
Generate \fBmake\fR dependency information only\.
.IP "\fB--dep-phony\fR"
Generate phony targets for included/imported schema files, causing each to
depend on nothing\. Such dummy rules work around \fBmake\fR errors caused by
the removal of schema files without also updating the dependency file to
match\.
.IP "\fB--dep-target\fR \fItarget\fR"
Change the target of the dependency rule\. By default it contains all the
generated C++ files as well as the dependency file itself, without any
directory prefixes\. If you require multiple targets, then you can specify
them as a single, space-separated argument or you can repeat this option
multiple times\.
.IP "\fB--dep-suffix\fR \fIsuffix\fR"
Use the provided \fIsuffix\fR instead of the default \fB\.d\fR to construct
the name of the dependency file\.
.IP "\fB--dep-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Use the provided expression to construct the name of the dependency file\.
\fIregex\fR is a Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. See also the REGEX
AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--disable-warning\fR \fIwarn\fR"
Disable printing warning with id \fIwarn\fR\. If \fBall\fR is specified for
the warning id then all warnings are disabled\.
.IP "\fB--options-file\fR \fIfile\fR"
Read additional options from \fIfile\fR\. Each option should appearing on a
separate line optionally followed by space and an option value\. Empty lines
and lines starting with \fB#\fR are ignored\. Option values can be enclosed in
double (\fB"\fR) or single (\fB'\fR) quotes  to preserve leading and trailing
whitespaces as well as to specify empty values\. If the value itself contains
trailing or leading quotes, enclose it with an extra pair of quotes, for
example \fB'"x"'\fR\. Non-leading and non-trailing quotes are interpreted as
being part of the option value\.

The semantics of providing options in a file is equivalent to providing the
same set of options in the same order on the command line at the point where
the \fB--options-file\fR option is specified except that the shell escaping
and quoting is not required\. You can repeat this option to specify more than
one options file\.
.IP "\fB--show-sloc\fR"
Show the number of generated physical source lines of code (SLOC)\.
.IP "\fB--sloc-limit\fR \fInum\fR"
Check that the number of generated physical source lines of code (SLOC) does
not exceed \fInum\fR\.
.IP "\fB--proprietary-license\fR"
Indicate that the generated code is licensed under a proprietary license
instead of the GPL\.
.IP "\fB--custom-literals\fR \fIfile\fR"
Load custom XML string to C++ literal mappings from \fIfile\fR\. This
mechanism can be useful if you are using a custom character encoding and some
of the strings in your schemas, for example element/attribute names or
enumeration values, contain non-ASCII characters\. In this case you will need
to provide a custom mapping to C++ literals for such strings\. The format of
this file is specified in the \fBcustom-literals\.xsd\fR XML Schema file that
can be found in the documentation directory\.
.IP "\fB--preserve-anonymous\fR"
Preserve anonymous types\. By default anonymous types are automatically named
with names derived from the enclosing elements/attributes\. Because mappings
implemented by this compiler require all types to be named, this option is
only useful if you want to make sure your schemas don't have anonymous types\.
.IP "\fB--show-anonymous\fR"
Show elements and attributes that are of anonymous types\. This option only
makes sense together with the \fB--preserve-anonymous\fR option\.
.IP "\fB--anonymous-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Add \fIregex\fR to the list of regular expressions used to derive names for
anonymous types from the enclosing attributes/elements\. \fIregex\fR is a
Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. Any character can be
used as a delimiter instead of '\fB/\fR'\. Escaping of the delimiter character
in \fIpattern\fR or \fIreplacement\fR is not supported\.

All the regular expressions are pushed into a stack with the last specified
expression considered first\. The first match that succeeds is used\. Regular
expressions are applied to a string in the form

\fIfilename\fR \fInamespace\fR \fIxpath\fR\fR

For instance:

\fBhello\.xsd http://example\.com/hello element\fR

\fBhello\.xsd http://example\.com/hello type/element\fR

As an example, the following expression makes all the derived names start with
capital letters\. This could be useful when your naming convention requires
type names to start with capital letters:

\fB%\.* \.* (\.+/)*(\.+)%\eu$2%\fR

See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--anonymous-regex-trace\fR"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the
\fB--anonymous-regex\fR option\. Use this option to find out why your regular
expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.
.IP "\fB--location-map\fR \fIol\fR=\fInl\fR"
Map the original schema location \fIol\fR that is specified in the XML Schema
include or import elements to new schema location \fInl\fR\. Repeat this
option to map more than one schema location\. For example, the following
option maps the \fBhttp://example\.com/foo\.xsd\fR URL to the \fBfoo\.xsd\fR
local file\.

\fB--location-map http://example\.com/foo\.xsd=foo\.xsd\fR
.IP "\fB--location-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Add \fIregex\fR to the list of regular expressions used to map schema
locations that are specified in the XML Schema include or import elements\.
\fIregex\fR is a Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. Any character can be
used as a delimiter instead of '\fB/\fR'\. Escaping of the delimiter character
in \fIpattern\fR or \fIreplacement\fR is not supported\. All the regular
expressions are pushed into a stack with the last specified expression
considered first\. The first match that succeeds is used\.

For example, the following expression maps URL locations in the form
\fBhttp://example\.com/foo/bar\.xsd\fR to local files in the form
\fBbar\.xsd\fR:

\fB%http://\.+/(\.+)%$1%\fR

See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--location-regex-trace\fR"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the
\fB--location-regex\fR option\. Use this option to find out why your regular
expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.
.IP "\fB--file-per-type\fR"
Generate a separate set of C++ files for each type defined in XML Schema\.
Note that in this mode you only need to compile the root schema(s) and the
code will be generated for all included and imported schemas\. This
compilation mode is primarily useful when some of your schemas cannot be
compiled separately or have cyclic dependencies which involve type
inheritance\. Other options related to this mode are: \fB--type-file-regex\fR,
\fB--schema-file-regex\fR, \fB--fat-type-file\fR, and \fB--file-list\fR\.
.IP "\fB--type-file-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Add \fIregex\fR to the list of regular expressions used to translate type
names to file names when the \fB--file-per-type\fR option is specified\.
\fIregex\fR is a Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. Any character can be
used as a delimiter instead of '\fB/\fR'\. Escaping of the delimiter character
in \fIpattern\fR or \fIreplacement\fR is not supported\. All the regular
expressions are pushed into a stack with the last specified expression
considered first\. The first match that succeeds is used\. Regular expressions
are applied to a string in the form

\fInamespace\fR \fItype-name\fR\fR

For example, the following expression maps type \fBfoo\fR that is defined in
the \fBhttp://example\.com/bar\fR namespace to file name \fBbar-foo\fR:

\fB%http://example\.com/(\.+) (\.+)%$1-$2%\fR

See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--type-file-regex-trace\fR"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the
\fB--type-file-regex\fR option\. Use this option to find out why your regular
expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.
.IP "\fB--schema-file-regex\fR \fIregex\fR"
Add \fIregex\fR to the list of regular expressions used to translate schema
file names when the \fB--file-per-type\fR option is specified\. \fIregex\fR is
a Perl-like regular expression in the form
\fB/\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB/\fR\fIreplacement\fR\fB/\fR\fR\. Any character can be
used as a delimiter instead of '\fB/\fR'\. Escaping of the delimiter character
in \fIpattern\fR or \fIreplacement\fR is not supported\. All the regular
expressions are pushed into a stack with the last specified expression
considered first\. The first match that succeeds is used\. Regular Expressions
are applied to the absolute filesystem path of a schema file and the result,
including the directory part, if any, is used to derive the \fB#include\fR
directive paths as well as the generated C++ file paths\. This option, along
with \fB--type-file-regex\fR are primarily useful to place the generated files
into subdirectories or to resolve file name conflicts\.

For example, the following expression maps schema files in the
\fBfoo/1\.0\.0/\fR subdirectory to the files in the \fBfoo/\fR subdirectory\.
As a result, the \fB#include\fR directive paths for such schemas will be in
the \fBfoo/schema\.hxx\fR form and the generated C++ files will be placed into
the \fBfoo/\fR subdirectory:

\fB%\.*/foo/1\.0\.0/(\.+)%foo/$1%\fR

See also the REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING section below\.
.IP "\fB--schema-file-regex-trace\fR"
Trace the process of applying regular expressions specified with the
\fB--schema-file-regex\fR option\. Use this option to find out why your
regular expressions don't do what you expected them to do\.
.IP "\fB--fat-type-file\fR"
Generate code corresponding to global elements into type files instead of
schema files when the \fB--type-file-regex\fR option is specified\. This
option is primarily useful when trying to minimize the amount of object code
that is linked to an executable by packaging compiled generated code into a
static (archive) library\.
.IP "\fB--file-list\fR \fIfile\fR"
Write a list of generated C++ files to \fIfile\fR\. This option is primarily
useful in the file-per-type compilation mode (\fB--file-per-type\fR) to create
a list of generated C++ files, for example, as a makefile fragment\.
.IP "\fB--file-list-prologue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the beginning of the file list\. As a convenience, all
occurrences of the \fB\en\fR character sequence in \fItext\fR are replaced
with new lines\. This option can, for example, be used to assign the generated
file list to a makefile variable\.
.IP "\fB--file-list-epilogue\fR \fItext\fR"
Insert \fItext\fR at the end of the file list\. As a convenience, all
occurrences of the \fB\en\fR character sequence in \fItext\fR are replaced
with new lines\.
.IP "\fB--file-list-delim\fR \fItext\fR"
Delimit file names written to the file list with \fItext\fR instead of new
lines\. As a convenience, all occurrences of the \fB\en\fR character sequence
in \fItext\fR are replaced with new lines\.

.\" C++/Tree options.
.\"
.SS cxx-tree command options
.IP "\fB--generate-polymorphic\fR"
Generate polymorphism-aware code\. Specify this option if you use substitution
groups or \fBxsi:type\fR\. Use the \fB--polymorphic-type\fR or
\fB--polymorphic-type-all\fR option to specify which type hierarchies are
polymorphic\.
.IP "\fB--polymorphic-type\fR \fItype\fR"
Indicate that \fItype\fR is a root of a polymorphic type hierarchy\. The
compiler can often automatically determine which types are polymorphic based
on the substitution group declarations\. However, you may need to use this
option if you are not using substitution groups or if substitution groups are
defined in another schema\. You need to specify this option when compiling
every schema file that references \fItype\fR\. The \fItype\fR argument is an
XML Schema type name that can be optionally qualified with a namespace in the
\fInamespace\fR\fB#\fR\fIname\fR\fR form\.
.IP "\fB--polymorphic-type-all\fR"
Indicate that all types should be treated as polymorphic\.
.IP "\fB--polymorphic-plate\fR \fInum\fR"
Specify the polymorphic map plate the generated code should register on\. This
functionality is primarily useful to segregate multiple schemas that define
the same polymorphic types\.
.IP "\fB--ordered-type\fR \fItype\fR"
Indicate that element order in \fItype\fR is significant\. An example would be
a complex type with unbounded choice as a content model where the element
order in XML has application-specific semantics\. For ordered types the
compiler generates a special container data member and a corresponding set of
accessors and modifiers that are used to capture the order of elements and,
for mixed content, of text\.

The \fItype\fR argument is an XML Schema type name that can be optionally
qualified with a namespace in the \fInamespace\fR\fB#\fR\fIname\fR\fR form\.
Note also that you will need to specify this option when compiling every
schema file that has other ordered types derived from this type\.
.IP "\fB--ordered-type-derived\fR"
Automatically treat types derived from ordered bases as also ordered\. This is
primarily useful if you would like to be able to iterate over the complete
content using the content order container\.
.IP "\fB--ordered-type-mixed\fR"
Automatically treat complex types with mixed content as ordered\.
.IP "\fB--ordered-type-all\fR"
Indicate that element order in all types is significant\.
.IP "\fB--order-container\fR \fItype\fR"
Specify a custom class template that should be used as a container for the
content order in ordered types instead of the default \fBstd::vector\fR\. See
\fB--ordered-type\fR for more information on ordered type\. This option is
primarily useful if you need to perform more complex lookups in the content
order container, for example by element id\. In this case, a container like
Boost multi-index may be more convenient\. Note that if using a custom
container, you will also most likely need to include the relevant headers
using the \fB--hxx-prologue*\fR options\.
.IP "\fB--generate-serialization\fR"
Generate serialization functions\. Serialization functions convert the object
model back to XML\.
.IP "\fB--generate-ostream\fR"
Generate ostream insertion operators (\fBoperator<<\fR) for generated types\.
This allows one to easily print a fragment or the whole object model for
debugging or logging\.
.IP "\fB--generate-doxygen\fR"
Generate documentation comments suitable for extraction by the Doxygen
documentation system\. Documentation from annotations is added to the comments
if present in the schema\.
.IP "\fB--generate-comparison\fR"
Generate comparison operators (\fBoperator==\fR and \fBoperator!=\fR) for
complex types\. Comparison is performed member-wise\.
.IP "\fB--generate-default-ctor\fR"
Generate default constructors even for types that have required members\.
Required members of an instance constructed using such a constructor are not
initialized and accessing them results in undefined behavior\.
.IP "\fB--generate-from-base-ctor\fR"
Generate constructors that expect an instance of a base type followed by all
required members\.
.IP "\fB--suppress-assignment\fR"
Suppress the generation of copy assignment operators for complex types\. If
this option is specified, the copy assignment operators for such types are
declared private and left unimplemented\.
.IP "\fB--generate-detach\fR"
Generate detach functions for required elements and attributes\. Detach
functions for optional and sequence cardinalities are provided by the
respective containers\. These functions, for example, allow you to move
sub-trees in the object model either within the same tree or between different
trees\.
.IP "\fB--generate-wildcard\fR"
Generate accessors and modifiers as well as parsing and serialization code for
XML Schema wildcards (\fBany\fR and \fBanyAttribute\fR)\. XML content matched
by wildcards is presented as DOM fragments\. Note that you need to initialize
the Xerces-C++ runtime if you are using this option\.
.IP "\fB--generate-any-type\fR"
Extract and store content of the XML Schema \fBanyType\fR type as a DOM
fragment\. Note that you need to initialize the Xerces-C++ runtime if you are
using this option\.
.IP "\fB--generate-insertion\fR \fIos\fR"
Generate data representation stream insertion operators for the \fIos\fR
output stream type\. Repeat this option to specify more than one stream type\.
The ACE CDR stream (\fBACE_OutputCDR\fR) and RPC XDR are recognized by the
compiler and the necessary \fB#include\fR directives are automatically
generated\. For custom stream types use the \fB--hxx-prologue*\fR options to
provide the necessary declarations\.
.IP "\fB--generate-extraction\fR \fIis\fR"
Generate data representation stream extraction constructors for the \fIis\fR
input stream type\. Repeat this option to specify more than one stream type\.
The ACE CDR stream (\fBACE_InputCDR\fR) and RPC XDR are recognized by the
compiler and the necessary \fB#include\fR directives are automatically
generated\. For custom stream types use the \fB--hxx-prologue*\fR options to
provide the necessary declarations\.
.IP "\fB--generate-forward\fR"
Generate a separate header file with forward declarations for the types being
generated\.
.IP "\fB--suppress-parsing\fR"
Suppress the generation of the parsing functions and constructors\. Use this
option to reduce the generated code size when parsing from XML is not needed\.
.IP "\fB--generate-element-type\fR"
Generate types instead of parsing and serialization functions for root
elements\. This is primarily useful to distinguish object models with the same
root type but with different root elements\.
.IP "\fB--generate-element-map\fR"
Generate a root element map that allows uniform parsing and serialization of
multiple root elements\. This option is only valid together with
\fB--generate-element-type\fR\.
.IP "\fB--generate-intellisense\fR"
Generate workarounds for IntelliSense bugs in Visual Studio 2005 (8\.0)\. When
this option is used, the resulting code is slightly more verbose\.
IntelliSense in Visual Studio 2008 (9\.0) and later does not require these
workarounds\. Support for IntelliSense in Visual Studio 2003 (7\.1) is
improved with this option but is still incomplete\.
.IP "\fB--omit-default-attributes\fR"
Omit attributes with default and fixed values from serialized XML documents\.
.IP "\fB--type-naming\fR \fIstyle\fR"

Use a custom C++ type instead of the generated class\. The \fImap\fR argument
is in the form \fIname\fR[\fB=\fR\fItype\fR[\fB/\fR\fIbase\fR]]\fR, where
\fIname\fR is a type name as defined in XML Schema and \fItype\fR is a C++

\"
\" NAMING CONVENTION
\"

.SH NAMING CONVENTION
The compiler can be instructed to use a particular naming convention in
the generated code. A number of widely-used conventions can be selected
using the
.B --type-naming
and
.B --function-naming
options. A custom naming convention can be achieved using the
.BR --type-regex ,
.BR --accessor-regex ,
.BR --one-accessor-regex ,
.BR --opt-accessor-regex ,
.BR --seq-accessor-regex ,
.BR --modifier-regex ,
.BR --one-modifier-regex ,
.BR --opt-modifier-regex ,
.BR --seq-modifier-regex ,
.BR --parser-regex ,
.BR --serializer-regex ,
.BR --const-regex ,
.BR --enumerator-regex ,
and
.B --element-type-regex
options.

The
.B --type-naming
option specifies the convention that should be used for naming C++ types.
Possible values for this option are
.B knr
(default),
.BR ucc ,
and
.BR java .
The
.B knr
value (stands for K&R) signifies the standard, lower-case naming convention
with the underscore used as a word delimiter, for example: foo, foo_bar.
The
.B ucc
(stands for upper-camel-case) and
.B java
values a synonyms for the same naming convention where the first letter
of each word in the name is capitalized, for example: Foo, FooBar.

Similarly, the
.B --function-naming
option specifies the convention that should be used for naming C++ functions.
Possible values for this option are
.B knr
(default),
.BR lcc ,
and
.BR java .
The
.B knr
value (stands for K&R) signifies the standard, lower-case naming convention
with the underscore used as a word delimiter, for example: foo(), foo_bar().
The
.B lcc
value (stands for lower-camel-case) signifies a naming convention where the
first letter of each word except the first is capitalized, for example: foo(),
fooBar(). The
.B ucc
value (stands for upper-camel-case) signifies a naming convention where the
first letter of each word is capitalized, for example: Foo(), FooBar(). The
.B java
naming convention is similar to the lower-camel-case one except that accessor
functions are prefixed with get, modifier functions are prefixed with set,
parsing functions are prefixed with parse, and serialization functions are
prefixed with serialize, for example: getFoo(), setFooBar(), parseRoot(),
serializeRoot().

Note that the naming conventions specified with the
.B --type-naming
and
.B --function-naming
options perform only limited transformations on the
names that come from the schema in the form of type, attribute, and element
names. In other words, to get consistent results, your schemas should follow
a similar naming convention as the one you would like to have in the generated
code. Alternatively, you can use the
.B --*-regex
options (discussed below) to perform further transformations on the names
that come from the schema.

The
.BR --type-regex ,
.BR --accessor-regex ,
.BR --one-accessor-regex ,
.BR --opt-accessor-regex ,
.BR --seq-accessor-regex ,
.BR --modifier-regex ,
.BR --one-modifier-regex ,
.BR --opt-modifier-regex ,
.BR --seq-modifier-regex ,
.BR --parser-regex ,
.BR --serializer-regex ,
.BR --const-regex ,
.BR --enumerator-regex ,
and
.B --element-type-regex
options allow you to specify extra regular expressions for each name
category in addition to the predefined set that is added depending on
the
.B --type-naming
and
.B --function-naming
options. Expressions that are provided with the
.B --*-regex
options are evaluated prior to any predefined expressions. This allows
you to selectively override some or all of the predefined transformations.
When debugging your own expressions, it is often useful to see which
expressions match which names. The
.B --name-regex-trace
option allows you to trace the process of applying
regular expressions to names.

The value for the
.B --*-regex
options should be a perl-like regular expression in the form
.BI / pattern / replacement /\fR.
Any character can be used as a delimiter instead of
.BR / .
Escaping of the delimiter character in
.I pattern
or
.I replacement
is not supported. All the regular expressions for each category are pushed
into a category-specific stack with the last specified expression
considered first. The first match that succeeds is used. For the
.B --one-accessor-regex
(accessors with cardinality one),
.B --opt-accessor-regex
(accessors with cardinality optional), and
.B --seq-accessor-regex
(accessors with cardinality sequence) categories the
.B --accessor-regex
expressions are used as a fallback. For the
.BR --one-modifier-regex ,
.BR --opt-modifier-regex ,
and
.B --seq-modifier-regex
categories the
.B --modifier-regex
expressions are used as a fallback. For the
.B --element-type-regex
category the
.B --type-regex
expressions are used as a fallback.

The type name expressions
.RB ( --type-regex )
are evaluated on the name string that has the following format:

[\fInamespace  \fR]\fIname\fR[\fB,\fIname\fR][\fB,\fIname\fR][\fB,\fIname\fR]

The element type name expressions
.RB ( --element-type-regex ),
effective only when the
.B --generate-element-type
option is specified, are evaluated on the name string that has the following
format:

.I namespace  name

In the type name format the
.I namespace
part followed by a space is only present for global type names. For global
types and elements defined in schemas without a target namespace, the
.I namespace
part is empty but the space is still present. In the type name format after
the initial
.I name
component, up to three additional
.I name
components can be present, separated by commas. For example:

.B http://example.com/hello type

.B foo

.B foo,iterator

.B foo,const,iterator

The following set of predefined regular expressions is used to transform
type names when the upper-camel-case naming convention is selected:

.B /(?:[^ ]* )?([^,]+)/\\\\u$1/

.B /(?:[^ ]* )?([^,]+),([^,]+)/\\\\u$1\\\\u$2/

.B /(?:[^ ]* )?([^,]+),([^,]+),([^,]+)/\\\\u$1\\\\u$2\\\\u$3/

.B /(?:[^ ]* )?([^,]+),([^,]+),([^,]+),([^,]+)/\\\\u$1\\\\u$2\\\\u$3\\\\u$4/

The accessor and modifier expressions
.RB ( --*accessor-regex
and
.BR --*modifier-regex )
are evaluated on the name string that has the following format:

\fIname\fR[\fB,\fIname\fR][\fB,\fIname\fR]

After the initial
.I name
component, up to two additional
.I name
components can be present, separated by commas. For example:

.B foo

.B dom,document

.B foo,default,value

The following set of predefined regular expressions is used to transform
accessor names when the
.B java
naming convention is selected:

.B /([^,]+)/get\\\\u$1/

.B /([^,]+),([^,]+)/get\\\\u$1\\\\u$2/

.B /([^,]+),([^,]+),([^,]+)/get\\\\u$1\\\\u$2\\\\u$3/

For the parser, serializer, and enumerator categories, the corresponding
regular expressions are evaluated on local names of elements and on
enumeration values, respectively. For example, the following predefined
regular expression is used to transform parsing function names when the
.B java
naming convention is selected:

.B /(.+)/parse\\\\u$1/

The const category is used to create C++ constant names for the
element/wildcard/text content ids in ordered types.

\"
\" TYPE MAP
\"
.SH TYPE MAP
Type map files are used in C++/Parser to define a mapping between XML
Schema and C++ types. The compiler uses this information to determine
the return types of
.B post_*
functions in parser skeletons corresponding to XML Schema types
as well as argument types for callbacks corresponding to elements
and attributes of these types.

The compiler has a set of predefined mapping rules that map built-in
XML Schema types to suitable C++ types (discussed below) and all
other types to
.BR void .
By providing your own type maps you can override these predefined rules.
The format of the type map file is presented below:

.RS
.B namespace
.I schema-namespace
[
.I cxx-namespace
]
.br
.B {
.br
  (
.B include
.IB file-name ;
)*
.br
  ([
.B type
]
.I schema-type cxx-ret-type
[
.I cxx-arg-type
.RB ] ;
)*
.br
.B }
.br
.RE

Both
.I schema-namespace
and
.I schema-type
are regex patterns while
.IR cxx-namespace ,
.IR cxx-ret-type ,
and
.I cxx-arg-type
are regex pattern substitutions. All names can be optionally enclosed
in \fR" "\fR, for example, to include white-spaces.

.I schema-namespace
determines XML Schema namespace. Optional
.I cxx-namespace
is prefixed to every C++ type name in this namespace declaration.
.I cxx-ret-type
is a C++ type name that is used as a return type for the
.B post_*
functions. Optional
.I cxx-arg-type
is an argument type for callback functions corresponding to elements and
attributes of this type. If
.I cxx-arg-type
is not specified, it defaults to
.I cxx-ret-type
if
.I cxx-ret-type
ends with
.B *
or
.B &
(that is, it is a pointer or a reference) and
.B const
\fIcxx-ret-type\fB&\fR otherwise.
.I file-name
is a file name either in the \fR" "\fR or < > format and is added with the
.B #include
directive to the generated code.

The \fB#\fR character starts a comment that ends with a new line or end of
file. To specify a name that contains \fB#\fR enclose it in \fR" "\fR. For
example:

.RS
namespace http://www.example.com/xmlns/my my
.br
{
.br
  include "my.hxx";
.br

  # Pass apples by value.
  #
  apple apple;
.br

  # Pass oranges as pointers.
  #
  orange orange_t*;
.br
}

In the example above, for the
.B http://www.example.com/xmlns/my#orange
XML Schema type, the
.B my::orange_t*
C++ type will be used as both return and argument types.

Several namespace declarations can be specified in a single file.
The namespace declaration can also be completely omitted to map
types in a schema without a namespace. For instance:

.RS
include "my.hxx";
.br
apple apple;
.br

namespace http://www.example.com/xmlns/my
.br
{
.br
  orange "const orange_t*";
.br
}

The compiler has a number of predefined mapping rules that can be
presented as the following map files. The string-based XML Schema
built-in types are mapped to either
.B std::string
or
.B std::wstring
depending on the character type selected with the
.B --char-type
option
.RB ( char
by default).

The last predefined rule maps anything that wasn't mapped by previous
rules to
.BR void :

.RS
namespace .*
.br
{
.br
  .* void void;
.br
}

When you provide your own type maps with the
.B --type-map
option, they are evaluated first. This allows you to selectively override
predefined rules.

.\"
.\" REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING
.\"
.SH REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING
When entering a regular expression argument in the shell command line
it is often necessary to use quoting (enclosing the argument in " "
or ' ') in order to prevent the shell from interpreting certain
characters, for example, spaces as argument separators and $ as
variable expansions.

Unfortunately it is hard to achieve this in a manner that is portable
across POSIX shells, such as those found on GNU/Linux and UNIX, and
Windows shell. For example, if you use " " for quoting you will get
a wrong result with POSIX shells if your expression contains $. The
standard way of dealing with this on POSIX systems is to use ' '
instead. Unfortunately, Windows shell does not remove ' '  from
arguments when they are passed to applications. As a result you may
have to use ' ' for POSIX and " " for Windows ($ is not treated as
a special character on Windows).

Alternatively, you can save regular expression options into a file,
one option per line, and use this file with the
.B --options-file
option. With this approach you don't need to worry about shell quoting.
