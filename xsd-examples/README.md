# xsd-examples - examples for XSD compiler

This package contains examples for `xsd`, the XML Schema to C++ data binding
compiler.

The C++/Tree and C++/Parser mapping examples can be found in the `cxx/tree/`
and `cxx/parser/` subdirectories, respectively. For the summary of available
examples for each mapping, see `cxx/tree/README` and `cxx/parser/README`,
respectively. Each example also comes with its own `README` file that provides
a detailed description of the functionality shown as well as the steps to
build and run it.
