This is a "Hello, world!" example that shows how to use the
C++/Parser mapping to parse XML instance documents.

The example consists of the following files:

hello.xsd
  XML Schema which describes "hello" instance documents.

hello.xml
  Sample XML instance document.

hello-pskel.hxx
hello-pskel.cxx
  Parser skeletons generated by the XSD compiler from hello.xsd using the
  following command line:

  xsd cxx-parser hello.xsd

  Or if using Expat instead of Xerces-C++ as the underlying XML parser:

  xsd cxx-parser --xml-parser=expat hello.xsd

driver.cxx
  A parser implementation and a driver for the example. The
  parser implementation simply prints the data to STDERR.
  The driver first constructs a parser instance from the
  parser implementation mentioned above and a couple of
  predefined parsers for the XML Schema built-in types.
  In then invokes this parser instance to parse the input
  file.

To compile and link the example manually from the command line we can use
the following commands (replace 'c++' with your C++ compiler name):

c++ -c hello-pskel.cxx
c++ -c driver.cxx
c++ -o driver driver.o hello-pskel.o -lxerces-c

Or if using Expat as the underlying XML parser:

c++ -o driver driver.o hello-pskel.o -lexpat

To run the example on the sample XML instance document execute:

./driver hello.xml
