This example shows how to handle XML vocabularies with multiple
root elements using the C++/Parser mapping.

The example consists of the following files:

protocol.xsd
  XML Schema which defines a simple bank account protocol with
  requests such as withdraw and deposit.

balance.xml
withdraw.xml
deposit.xml
  Sample XML instances for the protocol requests.

protocol.hxx
  C++ types that describe the protocol requests. These are
  hand-written.

protocol.map
  Type map. It maps XML Schema types defined in protocol.xsd
  to the C++ types defined in protocol.hxx.

protocol-pskel.hxx
protocol-pskel.cxx
  Parser skeletons generated by the XSD compiler from protocol.xsd and
  protocol.map using the following command line:

  xsd cxx-parser --type-map=protocol.map protocol.xsd

  Or if using Expat instead of Xerces-C++ as the underlying XML parser:

  xsd cxx-parser --xml-parser=expat --type-map=protocol.map protocol.xsd

protocol-pimpl.hxx
protocol-pimpl.cxx
  Parser implementations that construct the custom object
  model from an XML instance using the types from protocol.hxx.
  These are hand-written implementations of the parser skeletons
  defined in protocol-pskel.hxx.

driver.cxx
  Driver for the example. It implements a custom document parser
  that determines which request is being parsed and uses the
  corresponding parser implementation. The document parser
  intentionally does not support the deposit request to show
  how to handle unknown documents. The driver first constructs
  a parser instance from all the individual parsers found in
  protocol-pimpl.hxx. In then invokes this parser instance to
  parse the input file and produce the in-memory object model.
  Finally, it prints the contents of the object model to STDERR.

To compile and link the example manually from the command line we can use
the following commands (replace 'c++' with your C++ compiler name):

c++ -c protocol-pskel.cxx
c++ -c protocol-pimpl.cxx
c++ -c driver.cxx
c++ -o driver driver.o protocol-pskel.o protocol-pimpl.o -lxerces-c

Or if using Expat as the underlying XML parser:

c++ -o driver driver.o protocol-pskel.o protocol-pimpl.o -lexpat

To run the example on the sample XML request documents execute:

./driver balance.xml
./driver withdraw.xml
./driver deposit.xml
