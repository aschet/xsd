This package contains a number of examples that show how to use XSD, the
XML Schema to C++ data binding compiler and the generated C++ Tree and
Parser classes. See the README files in example directories for more
information on each example.

The package source code is in the public domain.

The project page is at https://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/xsd/.

The easiest way to build this package is with the bpkg package manager:

$ mkdir xsd-examples/
$ cd xsd-examples/
$ bpkg create cc
$ bpkg build xsd-examples@https://pkg.cppget.org/1/stable

But if you don't want to use the package manager, then you can also build it
manually using the standard build2 build system.

Send bug reports or any other feedback to the xsd-users@codesynthesis.com
mailing list.
